This page will explain my S18 and F18 work term that took place at Caranci Consulting Corp. in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. After reading this page, you will have gained insight into my experience and how I have grown as a developer.</p>

            <h2>Employer Information</h2>
            <p class="lead">Caranci Consulting Corp. was founded in 2009. They help their clients become operationally efficient with their specialization in ERP system implementations using Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Clients generally come from the manufacturing and distribution sector, and are located across Canada and northeastern United States. These ERP system implementations get used by clients with user bases between 50 and 200 users. These contracts can range in duration from 3 months to 3 years, depending on the scale of the implementation.</p>

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p class="lead">During my work term at Caranci Consulting I was a Business Analyst. My main responsibilities changed as the position progressed, but all revolved around developing enterprise resource planning software or support in database upgrades.<br /><br />
			My first two months were the training phase. My first task was to design a training package to assist with the onboarding of new developers to get them familiar with C/SIDE development and the related language, C/AL. At first this was a daunting task, having no experience with the required technologies, but it proved successful as I to had used this package and found it very useful with learning the required technologies.<br /><br /> 
			The second two months was applying what I had learned from the training phase. Most client upgrades that I got to work with were done with the pair programming methodology. Pair programming is something that I enjoyed as a second pair of eyes was helpful for finding bugs, and it was excellent for learning or showing new aspects of development with each other. This was a great environment to learn how to work in a team environment.<br /><br /> 
			Within my last two months I had used Python scripting to assist with the Go-Live implementations where clients would require the format of their records to be modified by me to meet requirements for their server upgrades. I had gained a proficiency with learning new Python libraries such as OpenPyXL to allow my scripts to properly interpret records that were exported into an Excel format. This period was especially rewarding as it allowed me to clearly see the progress I had made. With each new script or revision I made to an old one, I was able to improve the runtime with every revision.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p class="lead">There were two goals that I set out to accomplish this term. My main goal was to learn how to work as a team in a programming environment, as prior to this work term all of my programming experience had been done independently for academic or personal purposes. This was something that I was very nervous to be exposed to, as I was unsure how I would cooperate within a team environment. The secondary goal that I had was to learn how a business operates in general. This was something I have been curious about, as entrepreneurship may be something worth considering in the future and it may supplement the coursework for my minor. As the term progressed, a new goal presented itself to me, and that was to gain a proficiency in public speaking.<br /><br />
			Reflecting upon my goals, I would say that I have achieved the work term goals that were initially set out. Regarding programming in a team environment, this was something that I was greatly exposed to and became comfortable with. I no longer find the aspect of working in a team as intimidating, but find it very rewarding due to how advantageous you are when you have a team to provide or receive support from. This will clearly benefit my next work experience by having cleared all doubt from my independent mentality. With learning about how a business works, I feel that this has been accomplished as well. You can study business at school, but you won't truly understand until you are in a setting that demands you take a step back to understand the bigger picture. For example, a company doesn't successfully run by just having people come to "put their time in". When your business requires extra work to meet a time sensitive tight deadline, you must do the overtime to help your business succeed. You need to have people who are passionate about the work and push themselves to achieve that business success. Reflecting on my newer goal on public speaking, this was initially made because there were some instances that I had to present what I had made to my coworkers. In hindsight, I feel like I came off as a stuttering mess, but my coworkers did not feel that way. Whether they are sparing my feelings or not, I know that I can do better and seek opportunities in the future to improve this skill.	</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="lead">This was my first Co-op placement, and I could not be happier with how much I had learned at Caranci Consulting. They helped me to become a better programmer and drill in many concepts such as standardized formatting, documenting your code, and giving me a greater understanding of databases, as I had never taken any academic coursework in this subject. Working here was able to motivate myself to learn more, gaining a newfound excitement to continue challenging myself by trying new programming languages and technologies in my free time. <br /><br /> 
			Overall, my time at Caranci Consulting has been a very eye opening experience. It has always given me opportunities to better myself in the technical landscape, and I have taken this mentality into my personal life and will be bringing it with me into my future academic and work terms. I have learned to not get hung up on how many programming languages to learn, since I can always push myself to learn any new languages or frameworks that are required.</p>
